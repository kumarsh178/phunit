Globally installing the PHAR involves the same procedure as manually installing Composer on Windows: 
Create a directory for PHP binaries; e.g., C:\bin 
Append ;C:\bin to your PATH environment variable (related help) 
Download https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit-6.4.phar and save the file as C:\bin\phpunit.phar 
Open a command line (e.g., press Windows+R » type cmd » ENTER) 
Create a wrapping batch script (results in C:\bin\phpunit.cmd): 
C:\Users\username> cd C:\bin
C:\bin> echo @php "%~dp0phpunit.phar" %* > phpunit.cmd
C:\bin> exit
Open a new command line and confirm that you can execute PHPUnit from any path: 
C:\Users\username> phpunit --version

For Cygwin and/or MingW32 (e.g., TortoiseGit) shell environments, you may skip step 5. above, simply save the file as phpunit (without .phar extension), and make it executable via chmod 775 phpunit.
